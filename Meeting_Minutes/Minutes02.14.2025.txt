Within the Project Scope
	We need to make the read/generate excel/csv files point more specific and refer to the resumes from handshake as input types
	We need to add that the grader assignment should be incremental so that it can be updated if graders leave or courses are added
	Professors should be able to log in and specify or recommend graders
Within our Specifications
	We need to simplify our security section to say that we will be implementing the UTD netID verification system
Within our Tech Stack
	We will likely be hosting our web app using a UTD virtual machine instead of Vercel for security
Going forward we need status reports per team member and a plan for the next week at each meeting
Generally, our structure looked good but we need more detail and to get started initilizing things
Within our Timeline
	We should plan sprints per week instead of larger phases so that front-end and back-end can work in parallel each week
For this week
	we should research matching algorithms and how to get resumes (unstructured data) into a database (structured)
