Feedback:
  Make login based on local password instead of trying to connect to SSO (low priority: post demo goal)
  Move assign button outside of the popup
  Allow creation of future semesters, just don't allow the same semester to be made multiple times
  In singular course additions: remove the upload file option, default to manual input fields
  Check whether "student id" refers to net id or school id
  Think about edge cases: candidates without resume, large datasets etc
