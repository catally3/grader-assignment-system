Weekly Report
	ER Diagram
	Matching Algorithm
	BAckend Operations
	NetID and Virtual Machine Process
		The professor will have to get permission for us to use the NetID authentication system
		We can ignore that auth system for now and use a basic login system until we have permission for the netID api
		We already have virtual machines, we just need to wait for the professor to give us the login info
	UI/UX Draft
		We need to revise this to account for entering all courses in a batch rather than individually
		Also need to account for the only user being the hiring manager
		We can share our UI progress directly in Figma going forward
Looking at the Excel Input File
	The 'Fully Qualified' field is automatically filled by Handshake as true or as false
	We should not fully discard false applicants in case there are not enough true applicants to fill all positions
Looking at Handshake PDF
	This is a big PDF with a list of students and then each person's resume
		The resumes may be one or more pages long
	We will have to separate each resume out of the pdf and parse for keywords to associate with each applicant
General
	We need to upload our weekly status rep[ort to github before each weekly meeting and it needs to have each person's tasks and the number of hours worked
	We need to figure out a way to match course number or titles to resumes
		The course list does not include required skills so we will need to use the course number to find the syllabus on coursebook and get keywords from there
Next Week
	Revise UI/UX and look at how figma can be exported to working code
	Figure out pdf parsing/storage for resumes
	Initilize database structure
	Backend people need to learn about node.js and express.js to begin matching algorithm
