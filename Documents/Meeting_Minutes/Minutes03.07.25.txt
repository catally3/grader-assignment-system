Feedback:
- Generalized and simplify the UI/UX, making it just focus on the uploading and assignment of the web app
- Taking into account the edge when hiring start a new assignment for new semester, the web app will ask if they want to have just current applicants or graders from previous semester also.
- Using different heuristic to parse and extract the data from the PDF as well as determine the weighting of each data that fits best with the criteria of the courses needed.
- Having keywords for the job descriptions of the courses needed to make the matching easier.
- Research about OCR for parsing.
